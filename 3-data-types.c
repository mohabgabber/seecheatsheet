/*
 * Data Types In C

 * char = Single Character, they can also be used to store integers between the range -128 to +127, which could be used to correspond to specific characters in the ASCII table
 * char [] = array of characters (We can specify the length of this array inside the brackets)
 * float = a number with decimal points, contains 4 bytes of data (32-bit precision)
 * double = A double, is literally double the size of a float variable, doubles contain 8 bytes of data (64-bit precision)
 * int = A whole number, contains 4 bytes of data
 * bool = A boolean value can only be one of those two either: true, or false
 */

/*
!Note
* When specifying the size of a string (Example: char mystring[5] = "hell";), the size must be n+1
* For example, if you want to store a string with 5 characters, make sure to specify a size of 6
* This extra size is used by the null character which is required in C
